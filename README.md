# Superstore-Analysis
Scenario

The Head of Sales at superstore would like to understand how the store has been perfoming since his appointment in 2015. He tasked you with the responsibility of analysing the store's data and gathering insights. He would like to know performance by region, state, category, segment, time and additional information that you can gather.


The repo contains
  jupyter notebook that displays my analysis process, 
  superstoreanalysis.py file which is a dashboard I made for the store using streamlit.
